# This game used the snake tutorial from 'Raspberry Pi User Guide as a base.  But then went on to add the below extras:
#   Ability to restart with Y or N and explanation copy
#   Some instructions for when the game starts aswell as a 'ready' option
#   Replaced raspberry square with an actual image
#   Give user feedback on HOW they died

# BIG LEARNINGS
#  Python creates a value and references that (as opposed to settings a value to a variables), this means that if you set a=1, then do b=a, then edit b=2, the pointer of both a AND b will go to 2
#  Mutable v Immutable (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HPC24nIy9E)
#    List = mutable (can change values)
#    Tuple = immutable (cant change values)
#    Not sure if I used in right way, but Tuples seemed great for static variables, as they don't break due to the value referencing point when being used as a default Or reset) value - see snakeSegmentsDefault as it's set as type tuple, but then referenced as a list() to convert it ready for use

#  Global variables must be set inside each function, but only required for write priviledges (not read)
